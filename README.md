## Optimizations

In fact, I couldn't do this in this project, I haven't done enough optimization for my codes, but the codes will definitely be updated and more optimized and more secret soon, and I will definitely update you soon.


## Installation

This repository is the front of the project and does not need to install anything special and you only need to replace your apis and host the project so that it is available!

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RealMamrez/PlaylistMan-Website
  cd PlaylistMan-Website
```
